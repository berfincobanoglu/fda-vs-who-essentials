# DrugMatch: FDA vs WHO Essentials

### ‚ÄúHow meaningful is FDA approval for global health?‚Äù

## Overview

This project investigates the intersection between pharmaceutical regulatory activity and global health priorities by comparing the top 50 most frequently approved drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicines List (EML).

## Why This Matters

The FDA is a leading regulatory body whose decisions significantly influence pharmaceutical investment and market direction. However, regulatory approval alone does not guarantee a drug‚Äôs global health relevance. The WHO EML represents medications deemed essential for meeting the priority healthcare needs of populations worldwide. By analyzing the overlap between FDA‚Äôs most frequently approved drugs and WHO's essential list, we ask a critical question:

> **"To what extent do market-driven approvals reflect essential public health needs?"**

## Key Insight

üéØ **Only 40% of the top 50 FDA-approved drugs are listed on the WHO EML.**

This result suggests a partial but limited alignment between the regulatory focus of the FDA and WHO's global health priorities. While many drugs appear in both lists, a significant portion of frequently approved medications by the FDA are absent from the essential medicines list, possibly reflecting commercial priorities over public health needs.

## Methodology

1. Extract top 50 most frequent generic names from the FDA dataset  
2. Standardize and clean both FDA and WHO drug names  
3. Perform direct string-based matching between the two lists  
4. Calculate match rate and output matched drugs  
5. Create a manual synonym dictionary to account for regional naming differences (e.g., ‚Äúacetaminophen‚Äù vs. ‚Äúparacetamol‚Äù) and optionally normalize names accordingly for more accurate comparison


## Results

* **Matched drugs:** 20 out of 50
* **Match rate:** 40%

prednisone
allopurinol
colchicine
fluorouracil
gemcitabine
```


## Interpretation & Context
This analysis reveals that only 40% of the most frequently approved drugs by the FDA are also considered essential by the World Health Organization. While this partial overlap suggests that some regulatory priorities do align with global health needs, the limited match highlights a critical gap.

FDA approvals are often influenced by innovation, market demands, and profitability, whereas the WHO Essential Medicines List is grounded in criteria like population-level impact, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility‚Äîespecially in low- and middle-income countries. The fact that a majority of FDA top drugs do not appear on the EML may indicate that global health priorities are underrepresented in high-income regulatory systems.

This finding raises a broader question:

To what extent does pharmaceutical regulation reflect global public health priorities rather than commercial interests?

By drawing attention to this misalignment, the project encourages reflection on how medicine approval pipelines can better serve global needs‚Äînot just local or economic incentives.


## Limitations

* Analysis is limited to generic name matching (no form/dose normalization)
* No time-based trend analysis was conducted
* Synonyms were only partially accounted for manually
* Therapeutic class or usage data not included


## Future Work

* Add approval data from EMA, Health Canada, and other agencies
* Explore temporal trends: how has the overlap changed over time?
* Include WHO country-level medicine availability data
* Expand synonym normalization with NLP or fuzzy string matching
